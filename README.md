# VRShipNavigation
 
# Welcome to our ship navigation learning platform. Our inspiration for the project is to help naval postdoc students understand more about various types of Navy ships (their properties) and different kinds of tactical maritime scenarios. Here you can learn about various Navy ship models and their properties. Moreover, you can learn about various real -life Navy ship behaviors from our interactive display panels with explanation of scenarios, images of scenarios, as well as videos of them all generated using Unity 3D and Unity VR Core.

# The apk file can be downloaded through our GitHub repository (it is published under ‘Releases’):  https://github.com/NoFocusGaming/VRShipNavigation.git
